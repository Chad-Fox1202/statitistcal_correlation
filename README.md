Using sql and python to perform statistical analysis on a large dataset 

I am currently engaged in a project aiming to investigate potential correlations between Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers and their history of undergoing Tommy John surgery. This endeavor involves consolidating various datasets using SQL. Additionally, I am utilizing Python to analyze the data and explore potential connections between performance metrics and factors such as the performing surgeons, medical institutions, recovery periods, team affiliations, and other relevant variables.
